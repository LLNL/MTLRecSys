Welcome to Multitask Learning For Cancer's documentation!
=========================================================

Hello, this is intended to be technical documentation that will make it easier to use data pipeline and the methods for recommender systems 
in this project. So far, this proejct consists of wrappers around open source software purposed for multitask learning between datasets containing drug/cancer interactions. For now, these docs aren't intended for developers trying to use this as an API but just collaborators who might want to use the code directly.
