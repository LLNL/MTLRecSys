title: "Issue Resources and Template"
---

*Issues* help you keep track of enhancements, updates, bugs, user questions, and other development tasks. Anyone can create issues for your repo, though only the repo's administrators can manage issues. Issues and pull requests are independently numbered in GitHub as they are created and can be linked to each other with hashtagged notation (see examples below). You may want to prescribe a template for your issues or provide guidelines in your repo's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/LLNL/.github/tree/master/community-health/CONTRIBUTING.md). GitHub has a helpful page on [mastering issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) that includes information about labeling and organizing issues/bugs.

## Creating an Issue

If you are creating an issue for another repo, be mindful of their contributing guidelines and strive for clarity in your request. It's also a good idea to review or search the list of existing open issues to see if someone else has already requested the feature or reported the bug. To open a new issue, navigate to the repo's Issues page (`/issues/new`) and click the green button.

**Title:** Clearly worded statement (e.g., `Create a page that explains how to create issues`)

**Body:**

* Describe if/how your request is related to a problem
* Describe the solution you'd like
* Describe alternatives you've considered
* Provide any additional context, such as screen shots
* Consider adding a checklist if you know the distinct tasks that must be done in order for the issue to be complete
* Mention/link to any related issues or PRs (e.g., `Arises from PR #123` or `Related to issue #456`)
* Mention (`@`) a specific person if applicable
